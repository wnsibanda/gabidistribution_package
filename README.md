# gabidistribution_package
A simple statistical Python package based on the object-oriented programming paradigm.
This package works with data represented by either a Gaussian or Binomial distributions only. With this package you can: 
- Read in a data file containing numerical data,
- Plot histogram from the data, corresponding to the particular distribution,
- Plot probability density function of a distribution.
- Add two of the same type of distributions, e.g., Gaussian A + Gaussian B,
- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of a distribution,
- Calculate the probability for a specific data occurrence.
- Tools: Python, Pycharm, PyPi, unittest, Github
